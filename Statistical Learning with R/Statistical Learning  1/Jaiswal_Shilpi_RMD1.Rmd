This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, echo=T, warning=FALSE}
# Problem 1
library(class)
df <- data.frame(X1 = c(0,2,0,0,-1,1), X2 = c(3,0,1,1,0,1), X3 = c(0,0,3,2,1,1))
Y = c("Red","Red","Red","Green","Green","Red")

train <- df
test <- c(0,0,0)

cl <- factor(Y)

```


```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}
#a 
dist <- rbind(test, df)
eucl_dist <- dist(dist, method = "euclidean", diag = FALSE, upper = FALSE, p = 2)

eucl_dist
```
The first column is the Eucledian distance.

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

#b
knn(train, test, cl, k = 1)

```

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

#c
knn(train, test, cl, k = 3)
```


```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

# Problem 2
set.seed(1200)
x <- rnorm(50)
y <- 2 + 3*x + rnorm(50)

reg <- lm(y~x)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

plot(x, main="Changing title and lables", xlab = "Index of Observations", ylab = "Observations")
plot(x, y)
abline(reg, col= "green", lwd = 2)
points(mean(x), mean(y), pch = "X")
arrows(1, -4.5, mean(x), mean(y), col = "red")
text(1, -4.5, "Center", col = "red")
```

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}
# Problem 3

#3a

college <- read.csv("C:/Users/jaisw/Downloads/College.csv")
fix(college)

#3b
rownames (college ) <- college [,1]
fix(college)

college <- college [, -1]
fix (college)



```


```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}
#3c

#3c i)
summary(college)

```


```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

#3c ii)
pairs(college[1:10]) 

```


```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

#3c iii)
plot(college$Private, college$Outstate, ylab = "Out-of-state tuition", xlab = "Private Colleges")


```

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}
#3c iv)

Elite <- ifelse(college$Top10perc > 50, "Yes", "No")
Elite <- as.factor (Elite)
college <- data.frame(college, Elite)
summary(college)
plot(college$Elite, college$Outstate, ylab = "Out-of-state tuition", xlab = "Elite Colleges")

```

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

#3c v)
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) 
hist(college$Outstate, breaks = 30  , xlab = "Out of State Tuition")
hist(college$Expend, breaks = 25  , xlab = "Instructional expenditure per student")
hist(college$Books, breaks = 20  , xlab = "Estimated book costs")
hist(college$perc.alumni, breaks = 15  , xlab = "Percent of alumni who donate")


```

```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}


#3c vi)
library(ggplot2)

accept.rate <- college$Accept/college$Apps*100
college <- data.frame(college, accept.rate)

p1 <- ggplot(
  data = college, 
  aes(x = accept.rate, 
      y = Outstate)
) + geom_point(aes(color = Private))
p1

```


#### See if Private colleges have higher fees and Acceptance rate.
```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

p2 <- ggplot(
  data = college, 
  aes(x = Accept, 
      y = Outstate)
) + geom_point(aes(color = Private))
p2

```

#### See if Elite colleges have higher graduation rate and PhD students.
```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

p3 <- ggplot(
  data = college, 
  aes(x = Grad.Rate, 
      y = PhD)
) + geom_point(aes(color = Elite))
p3

```
We can see that the Elite colleges have higher graduation rate and higher number of PhD's.


#### See if alumnis from Elite college donate more.
```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

plot(college$Elite, college$perc.alumni, xlab = "Elite", ylab = "Percent alumni donating")

```
We can see from the plot that the median percent of donation made by alumnis from elite colleges is higher than the non elite ones. This can be attributed to the fact that they probably earn more because of better abilities and better education, better peer group.


#### Relationship between Student Faculty ratio and Graduation rate and PhD.
```{r, echo=T, warning=FALSE}

d <- ggplot(college, aes(x = S.F.Ratio, y = Grad.Rate)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(PhD) ))

d

```
